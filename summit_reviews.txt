Very hoppy with a unique, slightly nutty, bitter aftertaste.  This is the way a Pale Ale should taste.  Most Pales tone down the hops to broaden their appeal.  Summit EPA pushes the hops and stands out as a great regional brew for ale lovers. <split>Just found a supplier in metro Detroit (Grosse Point Woods) and am thrilled to see this beer make its way further east.   <split>the best beer I have ever tasted.  THe taste is excellent with just the right amount of hoppy taste.  Well worth trying if you are visiting Minnesota. <split>Perfect. Best beer in upper Midwest. Summits other creations leave a little to be desired, but this is the standard for American Pale Ales. Clear amber Brown, creamy off white head, bitter, stinging hoppy taste, goes down smooth and creamy, very aromatic. Drink culminates in a crisp sharp aftertaste not produced by many beers; Most IPAs or PAs have a somewhat dull lingering aftertaste; Summits is razor sharp and tingly.  Most popular beer in Minneapolis/ St. Paul for a reason. <split>
This beer has it all.  And, its had it all since 1986.  This beer led the way for micro brew in Minnesota. It is the pioneer in the Beer Belt. Fantastic beer, with all around appeal. Solid, not fancy, made for the ages. <split>very refreshing beer with a great smack of hoppness.

nothing else to say about it.

 <split>This beer has it all.Good appearrance nice amber color to copper color.A nice head on it finger width or so good head.The hops are a near perfect mix smooth but yet hoppy enough to make you take notice.The beer sticks to glass all the way to the end. It has a real nice flavor .They hit this beer square on for my taste buds.My new favorite by far.The only beer that is a real close second is seirra nevada's pale ale or possibly te ton ale out of jacksonhole wyoming.This beer goes good by itself and even better with food.I love it with steak,and pizza alike.I toured this brewery and I was not disappointed when I got it fresh from the tap either.A tad better on tap but I prefer all beer on tap.A must try this beer Rocks!I have read other reviews on this beer .I really think some people are missing it.This beer is a winner and Summit's best going away. <split>A great, great Pale Ale. Its sweeter than most Pale Ales, but that sweetness is combined with a very full body and just the right amount of carbonation. <split>perfect minnesota beer. never boring, great poured or in the bottle, best out of a good fresh tap, a great example of what a small commercial beer can be.   <split>UPDATED: NOV 21, 2008 Good beer, bottle at a restaurant with a walleye meal.  Aroma of hops, pine and citrus.  Golden bronze in color with no head.  Flavors of pine, citrus and a small amount of hops.  Smooth with a slightly dry finish.  A refreshing beer.

So I had this on tap and it is sooooo much better on tap.  Awesome hoppy aroma and flavor, nice white fluffy head, and good bitterness. <split>UPDATED: JUN 17, 2006 Copper orange with a standing head.  Hint of hop to the nose.  Metallic-hoppy citric flavors.  Smooth.  Best choice I could find in Minot, ND (UPDATE):  First rated in ND when I lived in Nevada.   This became my "everyday" beer when I lived in Omaha.  Session after session ... between this and Goose Island IPA for my favorite midwestern brews. <split>Wonderful overall brew from one incredible brewery.  Its extra pale does not appeal to all but if you like hops, this brew is for you. <split>Crisp hop taste but not to dry.  I couldnt stand this ale when I smoked, but once I quit it tasted wonderful.  Best on tap or keep bottles cold because this beer has a short shelf life. <split>Lovely golden color with nice hoppy, malty nose. Nothing overstated here, the combination of the malt and hops is just perfect. I give it a high rating on drinkability and balance. Had this on draft at the Mall of America and it was heavenly. <split>This is one of the most unique tasting IPAs Ive ever had.  It has a strong hopps taste that I love. <split>This is one of my favorite beers, as it has great hoppy taste. It is not very bitter and are easy to drink. <split>A favorite since I arrived in the Twin Cities. A solid pale ale, more in the British style than American. About the best to my taste since Molston Pedigree. <split>A strong floral aroma. A clean sweet taste with a bitter finish. One of my favorite beers. <split>Just a fantastic beer. I hear it's not quite as good in the winter, but it made for an excellent spring-time treat.

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone <split>English style pale ale. A-nice subtle hops, earthy, grass, and dank. A- light amber hue with a little head retention. Good healthy lacing.

Nice nuttiness, good body.  Can quaff the heck out of this ale. <split>Looks like my ratings are all high, but Im doing my favorites first.  This is a regular go-to for me pretty much any time of the year.  Nice floral sweetness, medium bitterness, great cold and while waiting for that dang waiter to bring that gourmet pizza to the table.  Northerners can feel good about this one!  <split>This year has been all about Summit EPA. Ive been living in minneapolis for years and only drank Summit a few times. For some reason it was only recently that I really became interested in this brew.

I think the problem with Summit isnt necessarily the fault of the brewer - here in the twin cities it is very easy to get a bad Summit. Every place usually has it as their default Micro tap so a slightly dirty tap can ruin the crisp flavor of the beer.

On to the beer. Crisp, smooth with a nice hop profile. I prefer it cold, usually straight from the fridge as these flavors work better for me when theyve been chilled. The initial sip usually has a nice full hop but it doesnt build into a grapefruit flavor, rather it builds into an uncomplicated malty backbone.

Is it spectatular? Ehh not really. But living in the Twin Cities means you can get it just about anywhere and it is almost always reasonably priced. Two great reasons to pick a summit.
 <split>Born and raised in MN Ive been enjoying these as long as I have been drinking beer. A solid drinkable pale ale that doesnt get old after multiple pints. Great balance of malts and hops I happily get these on tap at local bars and get the occasional six pack.  <split>bottle.  Pours a very nice rich dark golden color with slight orange hue to it.  Pretty white head with excellent lacing down the entire glass.  Very appealing nose on this beer.  I get a lot of malt aromas and it has a bit of a sweet feel to it.  Not a ton of hop presence in the nose.  Wonderful balance of hops and malts!  Just when you think this beer is going to be all hops the sweetness of the malts come in at the end and even everything out.  It finishes very clean and leaves you wanting more!  This beer is a sure fire winner. <split>One of my favorite beers. It’s much better on tap but it is also decent out of a bottle. Not overly hoppy so a "new" beer drinker can have one and not be overpowered. Nice citrus flavors but not too strong. 

 <split>With medium body and average duration of flavor, it is one of the better extra pale ales out there.  The hops taste is about just right...not overbearing. <split>bronze amber in color, moderate head and lacing.  semi sharp start with a dry finish from the hopped up punch.  full flavored, clean finish.  Overall great pale ale that I would definitely drink again. <split>For what it purports to be, it succeeds. A lighter beer for sure, but has a good malt base with a hoppiness. Good.  <split>bottle.

 <split>UPDATED: MAY 15, 2012 In Minnesota this is the beer thats on tap everywhere.  So when youre at a place that only has Bud, Miller Lite etc on tap for other options, a Summit is a no-brainer.  So Ive had countless pints.  Comfort ale. 

Rich clear amber pour, with off-white head. Nice balanced of hoppy/fruity aromas and taste.  Slightly meaty bodied, satisfying. In every way it is good to excellent, solid brew, if not a world champion. <split>Poured from bottle. Beautiful amber colour pour with medium off-white head. Decent lacing. Dry and sweet. Citrus. This is a very drinkable beer. I always make a point to look for it at sporting events rather than the usual awful selection of Bud Light and Michelob Golden Draft. Generally keep a supply in the fridge at home. <split>With medium body and average duration of flavor, it is one of the better extra pale ales out there.

Overall great pale ale that I would definitely drink again. <split>Golden Pour with a light off-white head and a mild hop aroma.  Sweet malt flavors in the first part of the taste offset nicely by a slight bitterness.  Finishes with a bit of a nutty flavor while being smooth and clean.  Very Drinkable. <split>For what it purports to be, it succeeds. A lighter beer for sure, but has a good malt base with a hoppiness. Good.  <split>Pours clear and red-copper with a white whisp of lacey head. Aroma of pine hops and sweet malts. Nice light but pronounced hops and smooth malts. A honey touch. Bitter and bold but not overdone at all. All in all, a very nice, smooth and well crafted beer.  This is a great brew for washing down the trail dust and just enjoying the buzz. <split>What can I say, a good local (for me) beer that si an example of doing it correctly. <split>A fine crisp American Pale Ale I find it very refreshing! <split>A midwest classic.  By far better on Tap, Summit EPA never seems to travel well.  Elegant and balanced for this robust style.  More drinkable than many micro interpretations makes it a good choice for a pitcher or two with friends. <split>Summit Extra Pale Ale is great in the bottles and fantastic on tap.  I prefer it to the more expensive Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Its hoppier and cleaner overall.  This is the number one beer in our fridge year round because its so appropriate and drinkable almost any time. <split>UPDATED: JUN 9, 2003 Bronze/Honey appearance, spicy malt aroma, heavy on the malt and hops. Finish is decidedly hoppy.  <split>A dark amber/ copper color, and thin , disappearing head. Sharp, vibrant hops abound here...citrus fruits and more, grapefruit, apricot, cinnamon, sharp cheese? Long, exciting finish, the hops mingle among the taste buds, the lips, and gums. Great bitterness on top, medium body, warm and tingly. Thoroughly satisfying, but not particularly remarkable. A reliable tasty treat.

First of all, I think the commercial description is all too appropriate, its a beer for all: blue collar to white collar, its a damn good beer that should appease damn near anyone. Color is a brilliant copper, aroma a pleasing mix of hops and malt that might seem too hoppy for the BMC crowd. Nice medium body of balanced malt and hops. Again, to the BMC crowd, this willl seem "scary" and "dark". But this is actually a nice, drinkable beer, whether it is -20 degrees before a U of M Gopher Hockey game or a steamy 90 degrees before a blisterng Johann Santana, Twins baseball game. A quality beer, through and through, long live Summit! <split>on tap in brainerd, mn: pretty standard but good pale ale here, plenty of hop flavor and aroma going on for a pale ale, but not too much.  plenty of maltiness but i think it could benefit from being a bit heavier in the body.  easy to drink in quantity though ;) <split>Just a bit too hoppy for me, and for most people, but this is a good APA.  It needs balance with malt, or something, but if youre looking for a crunchy beer this is it.  Poured almost amber in color -- looked like an amber. <split>On tap in my basement tavern on a regular basis. Nice golden body after pour. Sweet, hoppy and crisp.  Off-white head with slightly hazy, dark gold in body. Foamy head stays at 42 degrees. Palate of malt and hoppy bitterness. I first had this back in 1988 and still proud to call this Minnesotan ale. <split>Just a bit too hoppy for me, and for most people, but this is a good APA.

Price went up in 2009 so not buying much this year <split>Poured amber color with slighly off white head in my favorite frozen beer glass.  Caramel malt flavor is evident, with a very pleasant after taste.  Very drinkable beer, I will certainly have another. <split>Amber/Orange Color with a mild haze with a foamy head and good lacing. Aroma of baked bread, floral hops, biscuits, & barley. Taste is mainly yeasts, dry & floral hops, pale malts and barley. Body is moderate in weight and the carbonation starts out in the middle but mellows out. Good Pale Ale! <split>Draft. Pours orange with off white head. Good lacing. Nose is some citrus. Taste is a moderately bitter with citrus notes. Some caramel. Mildly bitter finish. Good standard pale ale. <split>500ml bottle.  Brown-orange color.  Deep malty aroma. This is quiet pleasant surprise.  My first Minnesota beer, and a good one at that.  Subdued solid hop presence, great example of the APA.  Big malt and big hops.  Earthy and mellow, not astringent or overbearing in any way.  This is a great session beer. <split>The first beer I liked, ever. So it has a special place in my heart. It is tame and drinkable but not boring, a lot like St. Paul. A local beer should fit its surroundings, and this beer does that in my opinion. <split>Bottle. Noe of caramel and crystal malt, light smoke, faint fruit from the yeast, a touch gummy. Pours very lightly hazy orange with a dense and rocky off-white head. Taste is medium seet with low bitterness, some bread in with the crystal malt, has some dank and herbal hoppiness, faint stripping in with light dough, fain spice and even chocolate (dark caramel, at least). Some nuttier character with volume, and the earthy, herbal hop notes rule the finish and aftertaste, along with the dough/toasted malt. Crisp and very refreshing medium body, lightly oily but really just spilling over with round malt, an intense feel to match the flavor. If this were just a smidgen drier, Id love it even more, but as it is, I would absolutely reach for this one. <split>Another excellent pale ale. First I have had from this brewer. Nice and hoppy and crushable. Pours orange in color an smells hoppy. Had at Ruth kris. 

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone <split>On tap in Bloomington, MN  Nice amber color with a medium head with decent lacing.  Apparent hoppiness and citrus was present in both the aroma and the flavor.  Slightly bitter feel with an honest finish that held on to the tongue.  It is a good APA  good enough that I had it a few more times during my three day business trip to Bloomington. <split>Amber colour with a thin white head. The aroma is full citrussy hops and somewhat faint malty. The flavor is strong american hops with a nice crisp clean bite to them and a bit maltyness in the background. The finish is bitter, but in a very pleasent way. <split>UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 Bottle: Great pale ale.  Good hoppy aroma.  Moderate hop palate with a light bitter flavor.  I look forward to additional Summit beers. <split>500ml bottle.  Brown-orange color.  Deep malty aroma. This is quiet pleasant surprise.  My first Minnesota beer, and a good one at that.

A local beer should fit its surroundings, and this beer does that in my opinion. <split>This beer reminds me a lot of Sweetwater Brewing out of Atlantas 420 Beer.  Little bit of hops and sweetness on the nose.  Beautiful golden orange color.  Taste is indistinct American hops, grassy, some tangerine, and a good dose of caramel malt.  The flavors werent very distinct and the taste was a tad too sweet for me to thoroughly enjoy.   <split>12oz bottle pours a hazy dark copper with a nice head.  Aromas of pale malts some earthy malts a bit doughy.  Flavor is balanced starts off malty and sweet with some light hop balancing it out.  Body is medium and has a nice mouthfeel.  Finish is a bit sweet.  Drinks more like a bitter than a pale <split>For what it is, this is a very nice beer.  Doesnt try to be too aggressive, has just enough of a citrus flavor to set it apart from the macro varieties and not too overwhelming so it maintains its session qualities.   <split>Bottle. Noe of caramel and crystal malt, light smoke, faint fruit from the yeast, a touch gummy. Pours very lightly hazy orange with a dense and rocky off-white head.

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone <split>good pale with apricot-like aroma, malty, fruity taste with lingering hop finish <split>mmmm......beefy <split>Notice small hop aroma, Nice carmel color, falvor starts with tosted malt and carmel malts then finnishes with light hopp bitterness <split>Very impressive!!!  I was never a fan of Summits porter or IPA, but this came through for me.  Good hop/citrus nose, carmel color-taste is fair amout of malt at the start for an APA-finish is hop bitter, but not to strong.  Excellent APA for hop lovers! <split>"Deceivingly malty at the nose, as the pervasive flavor theme is hop bitterness. Nevertheless, Summit Extra Pale tries to do a little too much, and ends up a bit confused. Is it a malty brew? Or a hoppy brew? Too much hops for malt lovers and too much malt for hops lovers. Being of the latter ilk, I still appreciate their attention to hops, and it remains one of the States better offerings"--quote from wawood.  You guessed it, he is from San Francisco and he is gay. He is also not happy here in the snow blown state of Minnesota.  All he does is bitch.  Hey, Wawood what about those of us who like both hopps and malt?  As for my opinion I may be biased, being from here but I think this bitch is solid.  She has a light thin head with a heavy outter rim that laces the glass.  I dont know that I taste her malt but I sure taste her bitter hopps...I like it for what it is.  GO VIKES! <split>UPDATED: MAY 10, 2003 This is quite good. Much better than the IPA, not as bitter bite. Color was superb, head was nice with some pretty good lacing on the glass throughout. Nice bold flavor and aroma. Definitly one of my favorites so far. Have it with something spicy, and you'll really enjoy it. 

 Here's an update. Had it today on tap at Old Chicago on W. Lake Street. As Tony the Tiger would say..Grrrrreat! <split>Slightly copper golden. Hoppy nose--citrus and pine--lightly sweet. Medium bodied, prickly carbonation. A nice sweet malty backbone balances the hops perfectly. Well done. <split>Dark amber color with little to no head.  Not much on the aroma aside from some light hops.  The taste explodes with hops, citrus, and maybe just a touch of wheat.  Nice malt rounding out the flavor.  Medium carbonation.  Fantastic pale ale! <split>Had it on draft yesterday at Bodega, so the small head may have been a result of the bartenders pouring. Had plenty of lace and a nice reddish amber color. There was  a nice fresh American hop nose. Nice body and quaffable; however, there was a distinct taste of iron in the middle that was very distracting. Its a good session beer. <split>Had it on draft yesterday at Bodega, so the small head may have been a result of the bartenders pouring. Had plenty of lace and a nice reddish amber color.

Its a good session beer. <split>Had this at a bar in Sioux Falls, SD on tap.  It was a nice dark amber color.  Creamy white head.  The nose was that of a typically stronger pale ale.  The taste was crisp and bitter and the finish was full of hops.  I thought this was a pretty good beer and may have it again given the opportunity. <split>This was the pale ale that introduced me to the genre. Great for a beginner, average, but well crafted. <split>Poured a clear amber orange color with a huge head that laced great. The aroma was somewhat citru-like, couldnt really pick up on the hops and was worried bottle wasnt fresh. However, the flavor didnt disappoint. Full of citrus (some grapefruit) and nice floral and pine hops, very nicely balanced. The malt backbone was strong and enjoyable: caramel-like. Finish was a little dry and pepper-like, complemented the sweet malty backbone and American hops very well. Pretty nice stuff. <split>12 oz. Bottle. Pours a clear copper color with a thick fluffy white head and sticky lacing. The aroma reveals sweet malt with citrus and herbal hints. The flavor is very balanced between the malt and hops. Very well made beer. <split>Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a hazy chestnut color with a small khaki head. The aroma is sour nut, strong floral and fruity hops and light molasses and maple syrup. The flavor is sour nut, strong molasses and maple syrup and crisp floral and fruity hops. There is a tangy bitter finish.  <split>Wow.  Was I surprised with this beer.  Had it in the bottle at Canterbury Park in Shakopee, Minnesotaah.  Like it so much I had another.  Very hoppy.  Will definitely buy some next time I visit. <split>Bottle. from sampler pack. Amber color, clear. Very good. Nice balance of hops and malt. Some caramel malt flavor. Probably the best in the sampler pack. <split>On tap at Bubba Gumps in the Mall of America.  Pours a tranluscent amber with golden notes and smaller bubbly/creamy off white head.  Aroma of caramel, toasted malts and a nice citrus/floral hop nose.  Flavor of the same.  A really nice caramel/toasted malt/nutty flavor balanced with a nice helping of American hops. <split>Bronze pour. Light cloud. Small white head. Smells like a alfalfa field (Im from Wisconsin). First taste: major hops that quickly subside. Very drinkable. Slightly sour initially, then sweet, and lastly bitter from the heavy hops. Tasting some banana (bananas foster sweet). Doughy finish. This is a local favorite. Its under-rated as others have pointed out. I think there is a lot I am missing w/ this beer. Try to get one. <split>What I would call a "journeyman" beer in Minnesota; I drink it on tap more than in the bottle, but I’ll have it either way.  Pleasant, citrusy aroma from a typically somewhat frothy head.  Flavor is perhaps not as interesting as some of the other beers Summit makes (and other MN brewers), but that could be a familiarity bias.  Though I get the citrusy hops that most others who have posted are noting, I’ve never thought of this as a "hoppy" beer.  The malt balances well with the hops. <split>A rock-solid pale ale. This is a good entry-level ale for those who are trying to expand beyond "Fat Tire". Its also nice after yard work when you dont want a lager, but also want to be able to quench your thirst. <split>
Color is a bright varnish brown. Pours a decent layer of head, leaving nice lacing.

Aroma is of floral hops and citrus notes.

Taste is a little less on the floral hops, but way stronger with the flavor of citrus.

Mouthfeel is bitter at first, but then it fades away and goes down smooth. A medium level of carbonation.

Overall, this is a solid beer. Drinkability is solid and the cost is just right. Definitely something I will be purchasing again.

Reviewed on: 12-08-2008 01:20:48 <split>Purchased at Binnys in Chicago, IL as part of a 12 pack sampler, enjoyed after the last horrid Friday commute Ill have for a while!  Appearance is a very cloudy golden amber with a very frothy white head.  Aroma of bready/toasted malt with earthy hop profile and a bit of spices, richer than other APAs Ive smelled and more robust.  Taste is interesting, its good as its got a nice earthy/floral hop profile mixed with toasted malt, but its somewhat light when compared to other beers in the style with a slight touch of sweetness.  Its more hoppy than malty, but Id say in a 60/40 kind of way.  This would make a great session ale, Id definitely recommend it and think its the bees knees. <split>UPDATED: MAY 29, 2013 A great addition to the normal EPA lineup! Love the drinkability of this brew! Subtle hops and malt! <split>One of the best bang for your buck beers out there in MN.  Strong hoppy taste with the dark amber color. $11.99/12 pack <split>Copper color with caramel malts in the aroma. Taste is malty with a bit of nutty flavor, similar to a brown ale. Light hop bitterness. Very drinkable.  <split>Transfer from BA review on 8-23-12-
 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a deep golden-amber color with a big off white head. The head fades relatively fast to give a medium level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is rather light but nice. It consists of some bready malt and some caramel as well as a small hop presence of some pine and a little bit of apple.

 Taste  The taste begins with a light sweetness and a good bready base. As the taste moves on the caramel sweetness that was present in the beginning gets stronger and a presence of hops becomes more pronounced. While the breadiness gets lighter toward the end, the citrus and pine hop flavors develop further to the end of the taste, and when combined with the sweeter caramel and a light fruit flavor leave a bitter-sweet taste on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average to slightly above average with the carbonation level being on the lower side. The body is rather fitting, but the carbonation is a bit lower then would be ideal with a greater level likely giving it a bit more of a refreshing and exiting feel.

 Overall - A nice session brew with a nice flavors. <split>Nice orange/copper color with a slight hop aroma. Nicely balanced taste with just enough bitterness. Goes down easy and smooth. A nice beer for when you plan on drinking all day or for a hot afternoon thirst quencher, very enjoyable. <split>UPDATED: AUG 15, 2009 Draft, Northern Lights at MSP airport. Copper with a beautiful 3/4 inch creamy and lasting head. Aroma is spicy-sweet floral hops. Taste is slightly tilted to the spicy-sweet hops, but carries a nice undercurrent of earthy, roasted nut and caramel. Nice bitter finish. Palate is light-medium, tingly and dryish. Great session ale. <split>
